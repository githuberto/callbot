"""A module for running methods in a single thread.

Usage:
  class Adder:
    @threaded
    def add(self, a, b):
      return a + b

    @threaded
    def add_plus_ten(self, a, b):
      return self.add(a, b) + 10

  This ensures that when add() is called on its own, it's scheduled on the
  module's thread, but when it's called by add_plus_ten(), it isn't
  re-scheduled, creating a deadlock.
